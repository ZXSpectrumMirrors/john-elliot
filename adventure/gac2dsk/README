GAC tapefile converter (John Elliott, 14 September 2009)
========================================================

  If you are compiling this software, you need to have LibDsk 
<http://www.seasip.demon.co.uk/Unix/LibDsk/> installed. 

  Adventure games generated by Incentive's Graphic Adventure Creator use a 
BASIC loader that can't easily be converted to work on a disc system. The
two utilities described herein take a GAC adventure (in .TAP format) and 
convert it, either to a +3 disc image or to a less opaque .TAP format.

  These are command-line utilities. The syntax is:

gac2dsk { options } infile.tap outfile.dsk

gac2tap infile.tap outfile.tap

  where infile.tap is the tape file generated by GAC, and outfile.dsk or 
outfile.tap is the file you want to create.

  gac2dsk supports the following options:

-otype <type>    Set the type of the output disc image (default is to DSK; see
                 the list below).
-ocomp <type>	 Set the compression system for the output disc image (the 
		 default is uncompressed).

  The remaining options handle details of the conversion process:

-180		 Output in the standard +3DOS 173k format. By default, a 169k
		 format with a larger directory is used.

-720		 Output in +3DOS 706k format.

-dos		 Output in PCDOS 713k format.

BUGS

  Probably lots! I've only tested this on the 'Ransom' example adventure, and
/The Legend of Apache Gold/. Who knows what it'll do on other files?

LibDsk drivers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  The following LibDsk drivers are supported in the DOS build. Only the first
four are likely to prove useful:

floppy:		The system floppy drive
raw:		Flat file containing only sector data
dsk:		CPCEMU .DSK
edsk:		CPCEMU extended .DSK

apridisk:	Apricot disc image archiver
ydsk:		YAZE emulator disc image
cfi:		Compressed floppy image, used by FDCOPY.COM
