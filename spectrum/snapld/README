SNAPLD v1.02                                        10 June 2005, John Elliott
==============================================================================

  SNAPLD is a .SNA loader for the Spectrum +3. As supplied, it's interactive;
you input the name of the SNA file to load and a couple of other parameters,
and it loads and runs it. If you want to change it to load a given snapshot
file, then edit the BASIC loader (DISK) and replace the INPUT statements with
LET statements.

  The three questions you are asked are:

* SNA file to load> 

   - This one is fairly straightforward.

* Loader address>

   - SNAPLD needs to overwrite 14 bytes of the SNA file for its final stage
    loader. If you just press ENTER at this prompt, SNAPLD will either use 
    the bytes just before the stack pointer of the SNA file, or the first 14
    bytes of screen memory. If this causes your SNA file to crash, or you 
    know that there's free space elsewhere in the file, you can enter a 
    different number here.

* Lock paging (y/N)>

   - If you enter 'y' or 'Y' here, SNAPLD will load the SNA file in 48k mode.
    If you enter anything else (including just pressing ENTER) then the SNA 
    file will be loaded in USR0 mode; which has the advantage that if a 
    Multiface 3 is fitted, snapshots can be saved to disc. There are a few
    games (such as Alien 8) which only work if the memory paging is locked.
