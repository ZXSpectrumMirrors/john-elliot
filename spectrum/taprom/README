===============================================================================

  TAPROM is a program to load a custom (pokeable) Spectrum +3 ROM, at the same
time patching it with a system which simulates tapes using disc files. TAPROM
includes five utilities: TAPSNA, TAPE2TAP, ZXTCOPY, ZXTPUT and ZXTRACT.

  This archive includes TAPROM in two formats: as a .DSK image, and as 
a self-extract archive. To extract the archive, copy TAPROM.ZEA and TAPROM.ZEB
onto a +3, and LOAD "TAPROM.ZEB".
