  SAVERAM is a simple proof-of-concept program that saves the Spectrum 128
RAMdisk to tape in one operation (or loads it again).

  SVRAM.ZXB should be loaded at 8000h (32768). 

To save the RAMdisc: RANDOMIZE USR 32768
To load the RAMdisc: LET x = USR 32771

  On return, x will be zero if there was an error, nonzero otherwise.

  As I mentioned before, this program is a proof of concept, and there are
many ways it could be improved; the obvious one would be not saving empty
space.
