ZXLILO v1.0.0                                      22 July 2005, John Elliott
=============================================================================

  ZXLILO generates menu screens for the Linux bootloader LILO which look
something like the Spectrum 128 opening menu. 

  To use:

1. Install the latest LILO (version 22.7 at the time of writing). It is 
preferable to build LILO from source; vendor-supplied LILOes may have their
own incompatible methods of displaying menu screens. 

2. Compile and run ZXLILO. Syntax is:

	./zxlilo {number} {bitmap}

  where {number} is the number of entries for your menu, and {bitmap} is
  the name of the output file. If you omit {bitmap} the file will be saved
  as zxlilo.bmp; if you omit {number} as well, the bitmap will be generated
  with room for 5 entries.

3. Become root.

4. Copy the output file (zxlilo.bmp or whatever you called it) to /boot.

5. Edit /etc/lilo.conf. Remove any "message=" line and replace it with
  "bitmap=/boot/zxlilo.bmp" (or whatever you called your bitmap).

6. Run LILO and check that it didn't report any errors.
