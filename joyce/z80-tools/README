Introduction
============

  This comprises the Z80 source for all the JOYCE utilities and the "welcome to 
JOYCE" boot ROM. The build process does rather rely on utilities I've 
written myself, so if you try to build this you'll probably end up downloading
and compiling one package after another.
  You will need:

  >> A C compiler, eg GNU C.
  >> zxcc(1) from my web page:
      <http://www.seasip.demon.co.uk/Cpm/software/linux.html>
  >> GENCOM.COM from the CP/M Plus distribution:
      <http://www.cpm.z80.de>
  >> z80asm from z80pack: 
      <ftp://ftp.mayn.de/pub/unix/software/Emulators/Computer/z80pack.tgz>
  >> cpmtools compiled with LibDsk - see
      <http://www.seasip.demon.co.uk/Unix/LibDsk/>

Building
========
 
  Type 'make' and three files should eventually be generated:

* utils.dsk:    Utilities disc for JOYCE.
* utils16.dsk:  Utilities disc for ANNE.
* bootfile.emj: Boot ROM for JOYCE.

Parts of other packages
=======================

* utils16.dsk is based on the included pcw720s.dsk, which is in turn based on
 pcw720.dsk, a "boot/root" floppy from my distribution of PCW16 CP/M. 
 PCW16 CP/M can be downloaded from <http://www.seasip.demon.co.uk/Cpm/software/>
* The files in user area 1 can be built from the source code in the "cpmredir"
 directory of the main JOYCE distribution.
